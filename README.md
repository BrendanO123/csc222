# DE Computer Science CSC222
This is the general repository for my work in the CSC222 class through the Arlington Career Center. However, most of my work will be done through separate repositories which are linked here. As the class has now concluded, the repository has been archived.

## Repositories:
### Minecraft Clone in GLFW
For the first semester of the class, I mainly worked on a C++ Minecraft clone with OpenGL and GLFW. For more detail see: https://github.com/BrendanO123/GLFWMinecraftClone.git.
